DESIGN

Is the Jobs tab a good way to manage active/queued uploads and downloads?

TODO

(1) - Session Builder needs UI to browse system and select path to the image files for upload (NPM package for this? Wait to implement using Electron?).
(2) - Session Builder needs code to write session metadata (Use fs.writeFile, HTML5 localStorage, other?).
(3) - Session Builder needs code to upload session metadata to AWS.
(4) - Session Builder needs code to create S3 bucket/vault and upload.
(5) - Session Builder needs code to create an upload Job.
(6) - Site needs routing for login page vs. main pages
(7) - Site needs code to download JSON with user data archive metadata from AWS upon login.
(8) - Archive viewer needs code to handle selection of dataset and download from AWS.
(9) - Login needs to take user information and authenticate.
